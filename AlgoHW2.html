        <h4>Though restaurant naan is usually cooked in the intense heat of the tandoor oven, you can pull off this homemade version using a hot cast iron skillet. When cooked at the proper temperature, the naan will develop blistered bubbles with a lovely golden-black char. Reward yourself for a job well done by sopping it in copious amounts of curry.</h4>

        <h4>
            <ol>
                <li> Combine water, sugar, and yeast in a bowl. Let stand until yeast softens and forms a creamy foam, about 15 minutes.</li>
                <li>heat butter in a pan over medium heat until melted and sizzling. Quickly mix in garlic. Remove garlic butter from heat and set aside</li>
                <li>Add yogurt, bread flour, salt, and 1 tablespoon of the garlic butter to the yeast mixture.</li>
                <li>Stir with a wooden spoon until a shaggy dough forms. Knead by hand until dough pulls away from the sides of the bowl, adding more water or flour as needed.</li>
                <li>Place dough in a large bowl. Coat with a few more drizzles of garlic butter. Cover and let rise until doubled in volume, about 2 hours.</li>
                <li>Punch down dough and turn out onto the counter. Shape into a rough rectangle and cut into 6 pieces.</li>
                <li>Roll each piece into an oval about 1/8 inch thick. Sprinkle some cilantro on top and press lightly to adhere.</li>
                <li>Preheat a cast iron skillet until very, very hot, about 5 minutes. Cook each naan until large bubbles form, 1 to 2 minutes. Flip over, press gently, and cook until bubbles on the bottom are charred, 2 to 3 minutes more.</li>
                <li>Brush naan with more garlic butter before serving.</li>
            </ol>
